FastqPuri, an fq quality control and filter tool 
=========

Software and source code of `FastqPuri`. It creates quality 
reports of `fastq` files and filters them removing low quality 
reads, reads containing too many N's or contamination reads 
(unwanted rRNA reads, impurities coming from another organism, ...).


## Installation

Clone the repository, or download the source. Make sure that 
your system supplies the following dependencies for FastqPuri.

- OS: Linux (clang, gcc), Mac OS (clang, gcc), OpenBSD (clang)
- `cmake` (at least version 2.8), 
- a `C` compiler supporting the `c11` standard 
  (change the compiler flags otherwise),
- pandoc (optional, see documentation in `PANDOC.md`),
- `Rscript` (optional),
- Following `R` packages installed (optional):
   * `pheatmap`
   * `knitr`
   * `rmarkdown`

**NOTE:**  FastqPuri will work without the optional dependencies 
but will skip creating html reports if they are not available.

```
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild/ [-DRSCRIPT=/path/to/my/R/bin/Rscript ... ]
$ cd build 
$ make 
$ sudo make install  
```

When running cmake, there are some variables you can set 
using the option -D followed by the variable name. This variables are, 

- `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`: `C` compiler (default `gcc`)
- `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`: compiler flags (default `-Wall -O3 -march=native -std=c11`).
- `PANDOC`: `pandoc` executable (default `pandoc`),
- `RSCRIPT`:  `Rscript` executable (default `Rscript`), 
- `READ_MAXLEN`: Maximum Illumina read length (default 400),

The executables will be created in the folder `bin` and installed in `/usr/local/bin`. 
`R` scripts will be installed in `usr/local/share/FastqPuri/R`. 

**WARNING:** do not move the executables that depend on `R` scripts, 
anywhere else, unless you also move the corresponding `R` scripts respecting
the local folder structure. 


## Executables

* `Qreport`: creates a quality report in html format (see `README_Qreport.md`),
* `Sreport`: creates a summary report in html format on a set of samples, 
   regarding either the original files or the filtering process
   (see `README_Sreport.md`),
* `makeBloom`: creates a  bloom filter from a fata file of a certain size,
   and stores it in a file (see `README_makeBloom.md`)
* `makeTree`: creates a tree of a certain depth from a fasta file and stores
 it in a file (see `README_makeTree.md`),
* `trimFilter`: performs the filtering process for single-end data 
   (see `README_trimFilter.md`).
* `trimFilterPE`: performs the filtering process for double stranded data 
   (see `README_trimFilterPE.md`).

An exemplar work flow could be:

* `Qreport`
* `Sreport`
* `makeBloom`
* `trimFilter` or `trimFilterPE`
* `Qreport`
* `Sreport`

## Documentation of the code

A Doxygen documentation of the code is available: 
- `html` version under the folder `html` (open `index.html` with a browser).
- `pdf` version: `latex/refman.pdf`

## Use a docker container for FastqPuri

The file Dockerfile documents the exact linux installation we used for
testing. If you have a docker installation ready on your machine, you
may want to use a docker container for easy installation and
capsulated usage of FastqPuri. After cloning this project from github
and change to its main directory, you may install a docker container
as follows:

```
$ docker build -t fastqpuri .
```

This will create a container based on the debian linux distribution
covering all dependencies including R and pandoc. Alternativly, you
can also pull a pre-built image from the docker hub as follows:

```
$ docker pull clottaz/fastqpuri:1.0
```

As soon as such a container is installed, you can use it either
interactively:

```
$ docker run -v $PWD:/tmp -it fastqpuri
```

or by running a pipeline implemented in an executable bash script:

```
$ docker run -v $PWD:/tmp fastqpuri ./pipeline.sh
```

Note that this call generates results in the docker container
directory /tmp and stores them also after closing the docker container
in the current local directory.
